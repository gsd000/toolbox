This is an extension called the Toolbox.

It adds a menu to Godot Engine that gives you some fairly simple functionality. It allows you to add some basic shapes using one click 
as well as an FPS controller. This is a very poorly written early version of this. 
You can modify and add whatever you want to it.

I made this so I can prototype and make stuff a little easier.

If the FPS controller gives you a ton of errors its cause you need to setup the input maps.

I don't know if anyone else at all felt the need for this type of plugin, but I thought I'd put it out here open source
just in case somebody wants to make something useful out of it.
